## Meeting with Karin on 25th of July 

1. Modify the methods section 
2. Genome size with contamination
   - Reference genome size is 4.7MB. Some of the genome sizes are abnormal (more than 5MB and upto 9MB). Look at the kraken2 results and see if there is any contamination which explains the abnnormal size
   - Create a table to explain
4. Sample  2019-1-3544-11-1 should be checked for why the number of contigs is so high and N50 is good. Check with the kraken2/bracken2 results.
   - Create a table for it 
6. Make the list of isolates which should be excluded from the further analysis and why based on the initial analysis.
   - Add it to the methods docs 
8. AMR results columns i,j,k should be in number format. It  contains dot instead of comma. 
9. Plots for AMR results showing samples in x and genes in Y
10. Plots for AMR results showing gene names in X and number of occurrences in Y
