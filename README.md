# Hafnia Reports

## Action Points: 
1. Check the quality of the data using Reads_QC (Hafnia spp project in VIGASP)
2. Check the species identification using Species Abundance pipeline
3. Use the reference data (Hafnia_PostiveControl project in VIGASP) given by Girum to find a cut-off for species identification process
4. Build Genome Assembly for the Hafnia data in Hafnia spp project in VIGASP
5. Download the Gene sequences for the list of AMR genes given by Girum
6. Download the Gene sequences for the list of Virulence genes given by Girum
7. Run Abricate on the AMR and VirulenceGenes and tabulate the results.
8. Use CoreGenomeSNP_Phylogeny pipeline to build the Tree
