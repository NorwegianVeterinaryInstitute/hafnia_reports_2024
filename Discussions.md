1. Exlude 3 contaminated and 2 other islolates which are not part of this project: In total, we have 91 samples left
2. Create the table (supplementry S1) which contains sampleID, all QC values and genome stats 
3. Use only the AMRFinderPlus results skip MEGARES, CARD and NCBI DB Results
4. Remove the 3+2 isolates' results from AMRFinderPlus results
5. Remove the 3+2 isolates from phylogenetics and resrun
6. Make a multi facet graph for each gene with X axis as the % identity
7. Phylogenetics tree with number of AMR Genes in each isolates like the exmple below
8.
